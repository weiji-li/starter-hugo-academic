Hi! My name is Weiji "Victor" Li.

I am a senior undergraduate student from College of Engineering, Unversity of Michigan. I double major in Computer Science and Data Science, with a minor in Mathematics. My research interest is Human-Computer Interaction and Natural Language Processing.

I am currently a research assistant at LIT group, advised by Prof. Rada Mihaclea. Besides, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Eric Gilbert and Prof. Eshwar Chandrasekharan on Crossmod, and by Prof. Atul Prakash on Attacking Speaker Verification System.

Previously, I have done internship at Tesla, Lianlian Pay and Ant Group (Alibaba). 

I am seeking for M.S. in Computer Science for Fall 2022!
