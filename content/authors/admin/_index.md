Hi, there! I am now a Software Engineer at Tesla, working on Maps, Navigation & Autopilot.

I recently graduated with my master of engineering degree in EECS from UC Berkeley. My concentation is Data Science & Systems. I worked with [Prof. Anant Sahai](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sahai.html) for a year on a data pipeline for spectrum ([link](https://ml4wireless.github.io/adsb-nats/)).

Before that, I was a undergraduate student from College of Engineering, Unversity of Michigan, where I double major in Computer Science and Data Science, with a minor in Mathematics. My research interests is Human-Computer Interaction, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence.

During my undergraduate time, I was actively involved in research. I was a research assistant at [LIT](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) group, advised by [Prof. Rada Mihaclea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/). Besides, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Eric Gilbert](http://eegilbert.org/) and [Prof. Eshwar Chandrasekharan](http://www.eshwarchandrasekharan.com/) at comp.social Lab, and by [Prof. Atul Prakash](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~aprakash/) on ML & Security.
