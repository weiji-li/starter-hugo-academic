Hi! My name is Weiji "Victor" Li.

I am a master of engineering student in EECS from UC Berkeley. My concentation is Data Science & Systems.

Before that, I was a undergraduate student from College of Engineering, Unversity of Michigan, where I double major in Computer Science and Data Science, with a minor in Mathematics. My research interests is Human-Computer Interaction, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence.

During my undergraduate time, I was actively involved in research. I was a research assistant at [LIT](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) group, advised by Prof. [Rada Mihaclea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/). Besides, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Eric Gilbert](http://eegilbert.org/) and Prof. [Eshwar Chandrasekharan](http://www.eshwarchandrasekharan.com/) at comp.social Lab, and by Prof. [Atul Prakash](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~aprakash/) on ML & Security.

My most recent industry experience was at [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/). Previously, I have worked at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com), [Lianlian Pay](https://www.lianlianglobal.com/) and [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en) (Alibaba). 

I am seeking for jobs starting summer 2023!
